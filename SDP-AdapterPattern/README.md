> The intent of the Design Pattern is to convert the **interface** of a class into another **interface** that the **clients** expect. Adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of **incompatible** interfaces.

##### So in simple terms the Adapter Pattern is used to Wrap an existing class with a new interface, it works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This pattern involves a single class called adapter which is responsible for communication between two independent or incompatible interfaces.

***

### The easiest way to understand the intent of the Adapter pattern is to look at examples of where it is useful.

Let's say you wanted to use a method or a subroutine that someone else has written because it performs some function that you need, but you cannot incorporate the routine directly into your program;

As it maybe a third party software so you cannot make changes to their code and also you donâ€™t want to solve the problem by changing your existing code. 

Or simply the interface or the way of calling the routine is not exactly consistent or equivalent to the way that is related objects need to use it.

***

### Steps to implementing the adapter pattern. 

> **AGENDA** : The Adapter pattern allows otherwise incompatible classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by the clients. 

1. First we **identify the component(s)** that want to be accommodated (i.e. **the client**), and the component that needs to adapt (i.e. **the adaptee**).

2. Then **identify the interface** that the client requires.

3. **Design a adapter/wrapper class** that can match the adaptee functions to the client's requirements.

4. The **adapter/wrapper** class "**has a**" instance of the **adaptee class**.

5. The **adapter/wrapper** class "**maps**" the client interface to the **adaptee interface**.

6. The client uses the **new** interface.

### Types of Adapter Pattern

There are actually two types of Adapter patterns:

1. **Object Adapter pattern** : 
  * The **composition** approach or the "**has a**" approach to implementing the adapter pattern. 
  * In this approach the adapter/wrapper class relies on one **object** of the **adaptee class**. 
  * So when a **adapter/wrapper class** object is **instantiated**, it must **instantiate a corresponding** **adaptee class** object. Anything the adapter/wrapper object is told to do will get **passed** to the **adaptee class** object.

2. **Class Adapter pattern** : 
  * The **inheritance** approach or the "**is a**" approach to implementing the adapter pattern. 
  * In this approach we create a new class which **derives publicly** *from* our **abstract class** to define it's interface and **derives privately** *from* our **existing class** to access it's implementation.
  * So in simpler terms **unlike** the **Object Adapter pattern** which creates an object of the adaptee class and simply passes any function invocation to the adaptee class object, the **Class Adapter pattern** since it **extends/derives** from the adaptee class it is able to call the methods of the adaptee class from within it's new interface. (basically call adaptee class methods from it's own custom methods without an object.)
